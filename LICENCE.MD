	* **others** components is GPLv2 licences like: installer scripts, etc.
* **Noobz-ID** (the owner of **NoobzVpn-Server** and **NoobzVpn-Client**) does not  allow  any modifications to the **proprietary** file/software. you can pull request to add new features or report weird bugs.
* **Noobz-ID** not guaranteed any effect/action for using this software. believe me, this is just tunneling packet no malware, minning or collect/send data to third party, etc, unless you use pirated/hijack version of this software (still not believe? don't use it). **DWYOR !!!**

### LIBEV :
* Event IO used in **noobzvpns**
* Website: [http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html](http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev.html)
```
libev is a high-performance event loop/event model with lots of features.  
(see benchmark at http://libev.schmorp.de/bench.html)  
  
ABOUT  
Homepage: http://software.schmorp.de/pkg/libev  
Mailinglist: libev@lists.schmorp.de  
http://lists.schmorp.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/libev  
Library Documentation: http://pod.tst.eu/http://cvs.schmorp.de/libev/ev.pod  
Libev is modelled (very loosely) after libevent and the Event perl  
module, but is faster, scales better and is more correct, and also more  
featureful. And also smaller. Yay.  
Some of the specialties of libev not commonly found elsewhere are:  
- extensive and detailed, readable documentation (not doxygen garbage).  
- fully supports fork, can detect fork in various ways and automatically  
re-arms kernel mechanisms that do not support fork.  
- highly optimised select, poll, linux epoll, linux aio, bsd kqueue  
and solaris event ports backends.  
- filesystem object (path) watching (with optional linux inotify support).  
- wallclock-based times (using absolute time, cron-like).  
- relative timers/timeouts (handle time jumps).  
- fast intra-thread communication between multiple  
event loops (with optional fast linux eventfd backend).  
- extremely easy to embed (fully documented, no dependencies,  
autoconf supported but optional).  
- very small codebase, no bloated library, simple code.  
- fully extensible by being able to plug into the event loop,  
integrate other event loops, integrate other event loop users.  
- very little memory use (small watchers, small event loop data).  
- optional C++ interface allowing method and function callbacks  
at no extra memory or runtime overhead.  
- optional Perl interface with similar characteristics (capable  
of running Glib/Gtk2 on libev).  
- support for other languages (multiple C++ interfaces, D, Ruby,  
Python) available from third-parties.  
  
Examples of programs that embed libev: the EV perl module, auditd,  
rxvt-unicode, gvpe (GNU Virtual Private Ethernet), the Deliantra MMORPG  
server (http://www.deliantra.net/), Rubinius (a next-generation Ruby  
VM), the Ebb web server, the Rev event toolkit.
