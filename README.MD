# NoobzVpn-Server

### What is NoobzVpn ?

Independent tunneling protocol is now in stable stage git-master repository.

### How is work ?
Like other VPN this app just bypass network traffic like tcp,udp including dns. with wide-custom payload and more flexibility. unlike openvpn / ssh tunnel using Concurrent Transport, we use Multiplex Transport (like shadowsock) model with more flexibility to custom Transport model. :)

### Tunneling :
* Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6
* All TCP, UDP, DNS

### Transport :
* Dual-Stack IPv4/IPv6
* TCP plain & SSL (HTTP/WebSocket/Direct/Etc, custom with your own :p)
* UDP (QUIC/DNS/Etc) ? #comming_soon, we not include it yet. because very poor in my test. but we keep working on it.

### Configuration :
* `/etc/noobzvpns/config.json`

* 
|   key     |   range   |   type       | example     |   description             |
|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| tcp_std   | 1-65535   | number-array | [80,8080]   |server port of tcp plain protocol |
| tcp_ssl   | 1-65535   | number-array | [443, 4433] |server port of tcp  with ssl protocol |
| ssl_cert  | can't be empty | string-path | "/etc/noobzvpns/cert.pem"| ssl certificate, you can create self-signed certificate on your own. or using letsencrypt/certbot as alternative |
| ssl_key   | can't be empty  | string-path | "/etc/noobzvpns/key.pem" | ssl privatekey, both ssl_cert & ssl_key you can create your own. or using free alternative like letsencrypt with certbot |
| ssl_version | SSLv2, SSLv23, TLSv1_1, TLSv1_2, TLSv1_3, AUTO | string-unsensitive-case | AUTO | select spesific SSL/TLS version or set to AUTO for automatic selection (recommended, be flexible to client) |
| conn_timeout  |   5-60 | number-by-seconds   | 60    | give client connection timeout when no data arrived/sended |
| dns_resolver  | empty or resolv.conf path    | string-path   | /etc/resolv.conf  | dns resolver file, on many distribution like debian/ubuntu/base using /etc/resolv.conf to save dns address (nameserver), you can create and set new one (don't change /etc/resolv.conf) just create file like /etc/resolv.conf with "**nameserver dns1**", "**nameserver dns2**", etc. |
| http_ok   | [cr],[lf][crlf],[lfcr]    | smart-string-replacer | "HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols[crlf]Upgrade: websocket[crlf]Connection: Upgrade[crlf][crlf]" | HTTP response for send to client if client detected using HTTP/s transport  |

### SSL Certificate
noobzvpn server has default ssl certificate (self-signed certificate) generated by openssl 
##### SSL Certificate
```
/etc/noobzvpns/cert.pem
```
##### SSL Private Key
```
/etc/noobzvpns/key.pem
```
You can change it using your own certificate or free certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using [cerbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) or [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh) , see configuration details above to settings path for ssl certificate and ssl private key.
