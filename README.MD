# NoobzVpn-Server

### What is NoobzVpn ?

Independent flexible tunneling protocol with secure & customized transport.

### How is work ?
Like others VPN apps, it just tunneling network for All IPv4/IPv6 TCP, All IPv4/IPv6 UDP (include DNS) connection with secure (encrypted) & customizable transport.

### Transport :
* **Tcp Concurrent** : Bypass all network with single secure tcp tunnel. like: ssh tunnel, openvpn, etc.

git clone https://github.com/noobz-id/noobzvpns.git && noobzvpns/uninstall.sh
```


### Manage Service:

##### Start Service
* start service, you need to start it after installation to run noobzvpns service to serve the tunnel or to manage users database.

```bash
systemctl start noobzvpns.service
```

##### Restart Service
* restart service, if you change configuration you need to restart the service
```bash
systemctl restart noobzvpns.service
```

##### Stop Service
* stop service, if you want to stop it
```bash
systemctl stop noobzvpns.service
```

##### Auto Start
* enable auto-start service after reboot or at boot. (enabled by default)

### Configuration :
To changed configuration can be done by using text editor like (vim, nano, etc). also we add documentation each settings in there.
```
/etc/noobzvpns/config.toml
```

### SSL Certificate
noobzvpn server has default ssl certificate (self-signed certificate) generated by openssl.

**WARNING** : don't use default key.pem & cert.pem come from this installer, its dangerous for public server (security-issue: leak key.pem). we include the key & cert just for example. just use your own self-signed/signed key.pem & cert.pem (recommended as always).

##### SSL Certificate
```
# fullchain.pem / certificate.pem
/etc/noobzvpns/cert.pem
```
##### SSL Private Key
```
# privkey.pem / private-key.pem
/etc/noobzvpns/key.pem
```
You can generate self-signed certificate and private-key yourself, make sure **openssl** installed in your vps (server).
```bash
# 1. change dir to /etc/noobzvpns/
cd /etc/noobzvpns
# 2. remove existing cert.pem & key.pem
rm cert.pem key.pem
# 3. generate cert.pem & key.pem using openssl
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -sha256 -days 360 -nodes -x509 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
# 4. follow the step from command above ^

# NOTE:
# 1. rsa:2048   ; you can change value 2048 to 4096 or more for more secure.
# 2. -days 360  ; its give you 1 year (360days) valid certificate, you can specify your self.
```
Or, you can change it using your own signed certificate or free signed certificate from [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) using [certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/) or [acme.sh](https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh). then you can set the cert (certificate) and key (private-key) path in noobzvpns config.

### Commandline
For manage user accounts you can use the command line by execute ``noobzvpns`` in your ssh or terminal (shell) it will guide you how to do it.
